# 📜 Description

&emsp; This project is an inspiring initiative providing legal and emergency support for women facing, or who feel they may be at risk of, domestic violence. With the aim of offering protection and dignity, our agents are trained with comprehensive legal resources, enabling them to provide qualified guidance for women seeking a solid foundation for their defense. Through this support network, we not only strengthen knowledge of legal rights but also encourage each woman to feel empowered, knowing she is not alone.

&emsp; Furthermore, we offer an emergency support system that locates nearby police support centers, facilitating swift access to safety. An additional tool generates PDF reports that compile the evidence presented by each woman, meticulously organized to support their defense before the relevant authorities and ensure their right to protection.

&emsp; This project is born out of a commitment to empower women, providing them with support, guidance, and knowledge of their rights so they can rebuild their lives with the assurance they deserve to live without fear. Each step is designed to make them feel heard, secure, and supported in their pursuit of justice and respect.

# Personas

&emsp; Personas are semi-fictional representations of ideal users, based on real data about the habits, behaviors, needs, and challenges of a project's target audience. They are created from research, interviews, and demographic data that help define specific characteristics of different user profiles. In product development projects, especially in the creation of websites and platforms, personas are fundamental for guiding the team in understanding who the users are, what they seek, and how they use the product.

&emsp; o better understand the challenges faced in our area of work, we created two main personas: one who recognizes that she is experiencing a situation of violence, and another who has difficulty realizing she is going through the same problem. With this approach, our solution seeks to address both scenarios and develop a product adapted to meet the needs of each of these profiles. These personas have been mapped and can be observed in the following figures, along with their respective information.

&emsp; Andreia é uma dona de casa de 29 anos que depende financeiramente do marido, Anderson, e dedicou sua vida ao cuidado do lar a pedido dele, deixando seus estudos e emprego para focar na vida familiar. Ela passa a maior parte do tempo em casa, isolada e com pouca rede de apoio, o que a faz questionar a saúde de sua relação e sua própria independência.

&emsp; Esse perfil destaca uma mulher que, apesar de ter assumido o papel de cuidar do lar, sente a necessidade de retomar algum grau de independência e segurança pessoal. Ela procura informações e apoio para entender se a situação que está enfrentando se trata de violência e como pode buscar ajuda para sair dessa situação e atingir seus objetivos.

&emsp; Maria Maia Fernandes works as a counter clerk at a pharmacy and is the mother of three young children. She dedicates herself to household chores and caring for her children after work, being the primary provider for her family. To supplement her income, Maria is constantly looking for extra work to ensure her children’s well-being.

&emsp; This profile highlights a woman who seeks balance and security for herself and her children and wishes to free herself from a relationship where violence and insecurity prevail.

&emsp; With this information, our platform serves both personas by offering specific resources for legal guidance, emotional support, and access to safe, practical information for at-risk situations. With features ranging from mapping safe locations to documenting incidents, the platform is designed to empower women seeking safety and independence, providing them with the tools to make informed decisions and protect themselves and their loved ones.



# Conclusion

&emsp; This project represents a transformative step in providing critical legal and emergency support for women who face, or feel they may be at risk of, domestic violence. By equipping our agents with extensive legal knowledge and creating tools that allow women to document their cases and locate nearby support, we aim to build a foundation of safety, dignity, and empowerment.

&emsp; The emergency support system and report-generation tools are specifically designed to assist women in accessing help quickly and effectively, providing clear documentation for their defense and reinforcing their right to safety. This project is more than a technical solution; it is a commitment to empowering women with the resources, knowledge, and support they need to reclaim their lives without fear. We believe that through this initiative, we can create a network of trust, strength, and solidarity, affirming every woman’s right to justice and respect.
